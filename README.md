This project uses a csv file with data on the average rent prices for various size apartments (studio, 1br, 2br, 3br, 4br) in various states.

I created 2 line charts using Chart JS to demonstrate the change in rent price over time, both for various apartment sizes in CA and for specifically 2BR apartments in various states.
